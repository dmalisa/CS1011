# CS1011
This course provides an introduction to object-oriented software development using the Java programming language.

Emphasis is placed on translating written problem descriptions into robust software solutions. Topics covered include Java program structure, algorithmic problem solving and modularization, I/O statements, control constructs, looping techniques, class libraries, user-defined classes and methods, arrays, and ArrayLists.

- Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
- Design and document an algorithmic solution for a given problem statement
- Create and interpret complex expressions that use relational and Boolean operators
- Select the appropriate selection control statement for a given task
- Use while/do-while/for statements to control repetition in algorithmic solutions
- Select the appropriate repetition control statement for a given task
- Translate UML class diagrams into Java code
- Design and implement simple classes
- Design and implement class and object methods
- Use existing Java class libraries
- Design and implement simple Java programs
- Declare and use collections of primitive and object data using arrays
- Declare and use collections of object data using ArrayLists
